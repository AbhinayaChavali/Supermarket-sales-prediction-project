Supermarket sales price prediction is a crucial task for retail businesses to optimize pricing strategies and maximize revenue. In this study, we propose a machine learning-based approach to predict sales prices in supermarkets. The dataset comprises historical sales data, product attributes, and transaction details collected over a significant period.
The Supermarket Sales Price Prediction project aims to build a machine learning model that can accurately forecast the sales prices of products in a supermarket. It however requires proper and critical analysis to know what location and product type is best for a specific location.
In this project, a model is developed using machine learning algorithms to improve and accurately forecasts product sales. The results shows that our machine learning models can accurately predict sales prices, enabling supermarkets to make informed pricing decisions and stay competitive in a dynamic market. 
This project contributes to the domain of retail analytics and can serve as a foundation for further advancements in supermarket sales price prediction using machine learning techniques.
The results will shows that our machine learning models can accurately predict sales prices, enabling supermarkets to make informed pricing decisions and stay competitive in a dynamic market.
